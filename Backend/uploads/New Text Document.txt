I am Philip Raj, a senior citizen aged above 60, retired as of April 2024. My UAN account includes four Member IDs, each with certain amounts accumulated. While withdrawing my PF amount, I was unaware that all Member IDs needed to be merged before making a claim. Unfortunately, I claimed the amount from only one Member ID, Sudarshan Facilities (DSNHP00161760000056111), and only this amount was credited to my account.

Upon realizing this, I merged all Member IDs and attempted to claim the total amount. However, my claim was rejected with the reason stated as CLAIM ALREADY SETTLED.

Over the past few months, I have visited the PF office in Bangalore several times to resolve this issue but have not been successful.

As I am in urgent need of this amount due to health issues, I humbly request your kind intervention to resolve this matter at the earliest. Your assistance in processing my claim will be greatly appreciated.

As the website is not taking the Claim ID, here I have enclosed Claim ID-10050157641501004.
